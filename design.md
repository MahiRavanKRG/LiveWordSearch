# Design in software development means everything of what we write in a code.

Problem: I want to know the meaning of the word that I am seeing on monkey type.

Digest: It is hard to differentiate fbetween words I know and words I don't know. So, let's make a program that listens to keyboard and searchs all the typed works. A simple program, just run it using cmd line and it will keep showing me the words that I am typing.



Plan to solve the problem
1. Learn to listen a word from the keyboard
2. Search on internet what ever you get
3. From my current understanding you can now use chrome tab to search for a specific "string" using code. 
4. Now, shift from chrome to pure CMD line interface, you should type a word and your code should reply with the word meaning. Use internet for now, for future this can be made offline for all majour meanings, I imagine having one dictionary can make this app offline.
5. Now, our logic is ready, if your app can listen to keyboard live and reply with word meaning every spacebar then your prototype is ready, finish it into a proper product and then put it onto internet.

## Updates 

I have finished the skeleton/bare-minimum/Pototype and it works as an exe. 
Currently trying to make it into a chrome extention.

## Design

I don't have to cover Design in detail as only app1.py is the complete application, it has been refined from RefinedBasicLogicWithoutInternet.py and has all the things it needs to run. Other files are just testing files that I learned form and made tests on.
