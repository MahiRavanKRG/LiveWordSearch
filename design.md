# Design in software development means everything of what we write in a code.

Problem: I want to know the meaning of the word that I am seeing on monkey type.

Digest: It is hard to differentiate for words I know and words I don't know. So, let's make a program that listens to keyboard and searchs all the typed workd.

Plan to solve the problem
1. Learn to listen a word from the keyboard
2. Search on internet what ever you get
3. From my current understanding you can now use chrome tab to ssearch for a specific "sting" using code. 
4. Now, shift from chrome to pure CMD line interface, you should type a word and your code should reply with the word meaning. Use internet for now, for future this can be made offline for all mamjour meanings, I imagine haveing one dictionary can make this app offline.
5. Now, our logic is ready, if your app can listen to keyboard live and reply with word meaning every spacebar then your prototype is ready, finish it into a proper product and then put it onto internet.
