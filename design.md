Problem: I want to know the meaning of the word that I am seeing on monkey type.

Digest: It is hard to differentiate between words I know and words I don't know. So, let's make a program that listens to the keyboard and searches all the typed works. A simple program, just run it using the cmd line and it will keep showing me the words that I am typing.



Plan to solve the problem
1. Learn to listen to a word from the keyboard
2. Search on the internet for whatever you get
3. From my current understanding you can now use the Chrome tab to search for a specific "string" using code. 
4. Now, shift from Chrome to pure CMD line interface, you should type a word and your code should reply with the word's meaning. Use the internet for now, In the future this can be made offline for all major meanings, I imagine having one dictionary can make this app offline.
5. Now, our logic is ready, if your app can listen to the keyboard live and reply with a word meaning every spacebar then your prototype is ready, finish it into a proper product, and then put it onto the internet.

## Updates 

I am currently on part 4, and have faced certain setbacks.
I'll talk about them later.

# Initial thought process

## LiveWordSearch
### Search the words meaning as you type them on Monkey Type.

This project is quiet simple, whenever running this project will listen to your current keyboard inputs, whenever your spacebar whatever sequece of words you have typed will be considered one word and will be searched on the internet.

Inspiration came form daily use of monkey type. I am it's author @MahiRavanKRG and am a aspiring developer, I am practicing my typing skills on monkey type. During my daily practices I encounter many words which I don't know the meaning about, I found myself wishing that "it would be better if I knew the meaning of this word". Thus this project was born. Out of curiosity and my quest to add some projects to my resume.

###### WE SHALL FOLLOW THESE STEPS
>  1. ✅learn to listen to keys on keyboard.
>  2. ✅learn to make strings of one word from the listened output.
search one word after successfully making a string.
>  3. ✅do all of this consequently.
>  4. ✅make it one program that will run when I want it to run.
>  5. ⭕extract data from web/make a small GUI, I should not need to open chrome every time.
>>>  6. This is rather challenging, the logical part has been covered, now remains how to show this data. Most logical way in my head is to tag a text box to the cusor but that is rather challenging. Other way is to use another window, but that defeats the purpoose of convience. To not let the project hang in thin Air I will make a "Kaamchalau" window and later finish it in full glory
>  7. ❔add some gui and take it from CMD line to GUI.
>  8. ❔after making it bare minimum refine it inito a finished product.
>  9. ❔make it an application or a addon/extention for others to use.
