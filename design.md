# Design in software development means everything that we write in a code.

#### Problem: 
I want to know the meaning of the word that I am seeing on monkey type.

#### Digest: 
It is hard to differentiate between words I know and words I don't know. So, let's make a program that listens to the keyboard and searches all the typed works. A simple program, just run it using the cmd line and it will keep showing me the words that I am typing.

## Plan to solve the problem
1. Learn to listen to a word from the keyboard
2. Search on the internet for whatever you get
3. From my current understanding you can now use the Chrome tab to search for a specific "string" using code. 
4. Now, shift from Chrome to pure CMD line interface, you should type a word and your code should reply with the word's meaning. Use the internet for now, for the future this can be made offline for all major meanings, I imagine having one dictionary can make this app offline.
5. Now, our logic is ready, if your app can listen to the keyboard live and reply with a word meaning every spacebar then your prototype is ready, finish it into a proper product, and then put it onto the internet.

## Updates 

This branch purpose has been completed up until now. Working logic has been made now need to make the GUI branch proper. 

## Design

I don't have to cover Design in detail as only app1.py is the complete application, it has been refined from RefinedBasicLogicWithoutInternet.py and has everything it needs to run. Other files are just testing files that I learned from and made tests on.
