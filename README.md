## LiveWordSearch
### Search the words meaning as you type them on Monkey Type.

This project is quiet simple, whenever running this project will listen to your current keyboard inputs, whenever your spacebar whatever sequece of words you have typed will be considered one word and will be searched on the internet.


### Inspiration
This idea came form daily use of monkey type. I am it's author @MahiRavanKRG and am a aspiring developer, I am practicing my typing skills on monkey type. During my daily practices I encounter many words which I don't know the meaning about, I found myself wishing that "it would be better if I knew the meaning of this word". Thus this project was born. Out of curiosity and my quest to add some projects to my resume.
