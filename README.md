This project is quiet simple, whenever running this project will listen to your current keyboard inputs, whenever your spacebar whatever sequece of words you have typed will be considered one word and will be searched on the internet.

Inspiration came form daily use of monkey type. I am it's author @MahiRavanKRG and am a aspiring developer, I am practicing my typing skills on monkey type. During my daily practices I encounter many words which I don't know the meaning about, I found myself wishing that "it would be better if I knew the meaning of this word". Thus this project was born. Out of curiosity and my quest to add some projects to my resume.

WE SHALL FOLLOW THESE STEPS
[] learn to listen to keys on keyboard.
[] learn to make strings of one word from the listened output.
[] search one word after successfully making a string.
[] do all of this consequently.
[] make it one program that will run when I want it to run.
[] add some gui and take it from CMD line to GUI.
[] after making it bare minimum refine it inito a finished product.
[] make it an application or a addon/extention for others to use.
